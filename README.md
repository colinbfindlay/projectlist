# projectlist

## Description:
This is a refactored version of the book list which was used as an example in week 17 of the MIT course.

## How to Run:
1. Clone Repository to your local environment.
2. Open index.html in a Web Browser. 

## Roadmap for Future Improvements:
1. Eventually I would like this to be a live Project List where the user can Add, Edit and Delete the Projects.
